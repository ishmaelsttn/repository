<!-- And here are the objectives for the degree of software engineering -->
<P style="color:white;"> SOFTWARE ENGINEERING DEGREE OBJECTIVES
    <!-- I'm eager to trial and run all of these objectives -->
    1. Develop and test algorithms, strategies and methodologies to design, develop and test software systems.
    <!-- Learning a new coding language sounds like the best part (which we've started for the most part)-->
    2. Leverage the strengths of multiple programming languages and database integration in software development.
    <!-- I'm assuming this is where we are going to use the tools acquired to solve problems for different platforms -->
    3. Apply advanced development tools and methods to create software solutions for multiple platforms.
    <!-- New beginnings with test runs-->
    4. Analyze, select and implement appropriate professional software development paradigms such as Agile and unit testing
    for software projects.
    <!-- App development  -->
    5. Utilize professional software development tools and libraries for application and app development.
    <!-- I've thought about creating mobile apps numerous times -->
    6. Design, implement and possess the knowledge to publish mobile applications.</P>
